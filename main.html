		<h1>Heat Resilience Challenge</h1>

		<p id="main">We are an Arizona State University, Engineering Projects team focused on mitigating the impact of extreme heat on mobile homes in Maricopa County. Every year in Arizona, several hundred fatalities are reported due to extreme heat, with a disproportionate number of these occurring among mobile home residents. Moreover, extreme heat also causes a number of nonfatal health issues among mobile home residents, many of which go unaddressed. Reasons for these adverse outcomes include the high cost of air conditioning in the summer, socio-economic issues among residents, and the poor state of infrastructure in mobile home parks, among others.</p>
